# Tasks based on TA's feedback:

| No  | Name | Details | Assignee |
| --- | ---- | ------- | -------- |
| 1   | [Programmatically generate all figures/tables](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_group_31/issues/52)  | Confirm with the TA which tables and figures are not programmatically generated   | TBD      |
| 2   | [Move main function to the top of the file](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_group_31/issues/53) | Moving `main` function to the top makes it easier to understand. Ensure that scripts all run: `01_download_data.py`, `02_cleanup_data.py`, `03_generate_eda.py`, `04_build_model.py`| Yazan     |
| 3   | [Stack figure parts horizontally to reduce scrolling](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_group_31/issues/54) | Update EDA script to split Fig2 in columns  | Yazan      |
| 4   | [Lay figures side by side where possible](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_group_31/issues/55) | Clarify - probably figure 3 + table 3 and figure 4 + table 4 (make smaller). Fig 1 make horizontal (EDA script)     | Mai      |
| 5   | [Create plots to go along with the tables if possible](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_group_31/issues/55)  | Group consensus: No need to create separate plots for our tables. Same GitHub issue as above. Address those items  | Mai      |
| 6   | [Improve figure captions to address takeaways](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_group_31/issues/56)  | Highlight what the main conclusion is from each figure (1-4) MD report | Mai      |

## Questions

1. ~Do we pick which groups to obtain feedback from?~
2. ~Do all group members need to be present on the feedback meeting with the other groups?~
3. ~Does all of the feedback need to be addressed/implemented as a part of Milestone 3?~
4. Should we update README to reflect the new summary and changes?
5. Do we need another meeting to sync up?
6. REMINDER: please always use our project env when working on your tasks and remember to update it with new dependencies if you need any

## Group deadline: Saturday 5PM GMT+7
