## Questions

1. Do we pick which groups to obtain feedback from?
2. Do all group members need to be present on the feedback meeting with the other groups?
3. Does all of the feedback need to be addressed/implemented as a part of Milestone 3?
4. Should we update README to reflect out final summary?
5. Do we need another meeting to sync up?
6. REMINDER: please always use our project env when working on your tasks and remember to update it with new dependencies if you need any

## Group deadline: Saturday 5PM GMT+7
