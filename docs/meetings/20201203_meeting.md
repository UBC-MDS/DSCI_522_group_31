## Questions

1. Do we pick which groups to obtain feedback from?
2. Does the feedback need to be implemented as a part of Milestone 3?
3. Should we update README to reflect out final summary?
4. Do we need another meeting to sync up?
5. REMINDER: please always use our project env when working on your tasks and remember to update it with new dependencies if you need any

## Group deadline: Saturday 5PM GMT+7
